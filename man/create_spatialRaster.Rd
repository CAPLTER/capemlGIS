\usage{
create_spatialRaster(
  rasterFile,
  description,
  epsgProjection,
  emlProjection,
  rasterValueDescription,
  rasterValueUnits,
  zipFiles = FALSE,
  geoDescription = "CAP LTER study area",
  baseURL = "https://data.gios.asu.edu/datasets/cap/",
  projectNaming = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rasterFile}{Quoted full path to raster file.}

\item{description}{Description of the raster.}

\item{epsgProjection}{EPSG numeric code of raster coordinate reference system}

\item{emlProjection}{EML-compliant reference to raster coordinate reference
system}

\item{rasterValueDescription}{Description of raster values}

\item{rasterValueUnits}{Raster value units}

\item{zipFiles}{Logical indicating whether spatial raster entity should be
constructed from a single raster file (FALSE, default) or entire directory
(TRUE)}

\item{geoDescription}{A textual description of the geographic study area of
the raster. "CAP LTER study area" is the default.}

\item{baseURL}{The base path of the web-accessible location of the data file;
the name of the resulting file will be passed to the base path to generate
a web-resolvable file path. This parameter is required with the default set
to the CAP LTER file path}

\item{projectNaming}{Logical indicating if the raster file (or parent
directory if zipFiles == TRUE) should be renamed per the style used by the
CAP LTER (default) with the project id + base file name + md5sum + file
extension. The passed file or directory name will be used if this parameter
is set to FALSE.}
}
\value{
EML spatial data object is returned. Additionally, if projectNaming
  is set to TRUE (default) the spatial data file is renamed with the project
  id + base file name + md5sum + file extension (zip in the case when
  multiple files are aggregated).
}
\description{
create_spatialRaster generates a EML entity of type
  spatialRaster
}
\details{
a spatialRaster entity is created from a single data file (e.g.,
  CAP_1985.img) or a collection of related files (e.g., CAP_1985.img,
  CAP_1985.img.aux.xml). In the case of multiple files, all files in the
  parent directory where the raster file is located are aggregated into a
  single compressed (zipped) file. In all cases, the resulting entity is
  renamed with the project id + base file name + md5sum + file extension (zip
  in the case when multiple files are aggregated).
}
\note{
create_spatialRaster will look for a project id in the working
  environment; this parameter is not passed to the function and it must
  exist.
