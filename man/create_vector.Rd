\title{Construct a spatial file of type KML or GeoJSON and create metadata
of type spatial vector}
\usage{
create_vector(
  vector_name,
  description,
  driver = "GeoJSON",
  geoDescription = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  projectNaming = TRUE,
  missing_value_code = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vector_name}{(character) The quoted or unquoted name of the spatial data object in the R
environment.}

\item{description}{(character) Quoted description of the vector resource.}

\item{driver}{(character) Quoted format of output file: KML or GeoJSON (default).}

\item{geoDescription}{(character) A textual description of the geographic study area of the
vector. This parameter allows the user to overwrite the geographicDesciption
value provided in the project config.yaml.}

\item{overwrite}{(logical) A logical indicating whether to overwrite an existing file bearing
the same name as the file to be written.}

\item{projectNaming}{(logical) Logical indicating if the resulting file should be renamed per the
style used in the capeml ecosystem with the project id + base file name +
file extension. If set to FALSE, the resulting file will bear the name the
object is assigned in the R environment with the appropriate file extension.}

\item{missing_value_code}{(character) Quoted character(s) of a flag, in addition to NA or NaN, used to
indicate missing values within the data.}
}
\value{
EML spatialVector object is returned. Additionally, the spatial data
entity is written to file as type kml or GeoJSON.
}
\description{
create_vector writes a spatial data file of type KML and
generates corresponding metadata of EML entity of type spatialVector
}
\details{
create_vector creates a EML spatialVector object from a spatial
data object that is read into or created within the R environment. If
present, the function reads attribute and factor metadata from supporting
yaml file(s) generated from the capeml::write_attributes() and
capeml::write_factors() functions - create_vector will look for files in the
working directory with a name of type "entity name"_attrs.yaml (or "entity
name"_attrs.csv if an older project) for attribute metadata, and "entity
name"_factors.yaml (or "entity name"_factors.csv if an older project) for
factor metadata. Note that this functionality is predicated on the existence
of a file containing metadata about the attributes, that that file is in the
working directory, and that the file matches the name of the spatial data
entity precisely.
}
\note{
If project naming is TRUE then create_vector will look for a package
number (packageNum (deprecated) or identifier) in config.yaml; this
parameter is not passed to the function and it must exist.

All vector objects are transformed to epsg 4326 (WGS 1984)
