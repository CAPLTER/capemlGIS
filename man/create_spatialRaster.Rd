\usage{
create_spatialRaster(
  rasterFile,
  description,
  epsgProjection,
  rasterValueDescription,
  rasterValueUnits,
  geoDescription = NULL,
  projectNaming = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rasterFile}{(character) Quoted full path to raster file.}

\item{description}{(character) Description of the raster.}

\item{epsgProjection}{(integer) Four- or five-digit EPSG numeric code of raster Coordinate
Reference System (CRS)}

\item{rasterValueDescription}{(character) Description of raster values}

\item{rasterValueUnits}{(character) Raster value units. Units must be EML-compliant or annotated by
a custom unit definition.}

\item{geoDescription}{(character) A textual description of the geographic study area of the
raster. This parameter allows the user to overwrite the
geographicDesciption value provided in the project config.yaml.}

\item{projectNaming}{(logical) Logical indicating if the raster file should be renamed per the
style used by the CAP LTER (default) with the project id + base file name +
file extension. The passed file or directory name will be used if this
parameter is set to FALSE.}
}
\value{
EML spatial data object is returned. Additionally, if projectNaming
is set to TRUE (default) the spatial data file is renamed with the project
id + base file name + file extension (zip in the case when multiple files
are aggregated).
}
\description{
create_spatialRaster generates a EML entity of type
  spatialRaster
}
\details{
a spatialRaster entity is created from a single data file (e.g.,
CAP_1985.img). The resulting entity is renamed with the project id + base
file name + file extension or base file name + file extension depending on
desired output.
}
\note{
create_spatialRaster will look for a package number in config.yaml;
congig.yaml::packageNum must exist in the project directory.

EML requires that geographic extents are provided as decimal degrees.
Because it is often impractical or inadviseable to change the projection of
rasters, a spatial coverage is not constructed if the projection of a raster
is in units of meters.

rasterDesc <- "NDVI for the central Arizona region derived from 2015 NAIP
imagery. NAIP NDVI data are presented as a series of tiles each representing
a portion of the overall central Arizona coverage area. The relative position
of this tile to the entire coverage area is detailed in the files
NAIP_GRID.kml, NAIP_GRID.pdf, and NAIP_GRID.png included with this data set."
