## capemlGIS: tools to aid the generation of EML metadata for spatial vectors and rasters

### overview

This package extends the
[CAPLTER/capeml](https://github.com/CAPLTER/capeml) package to
facilitate the creation of EML spatialRaster and spatialVector objects
and metadata.

### installation

Install from GitHub (after installing the
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html)
package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CAPLTER/capemlGIS")
```

### getting started

Creating a EML dataset starts with the
[CAPLTER/capeml](https://github.com/CAPLTER/capeml) package, `capemlGIS`
is designed only to facilitate creating EML entities of type
`spatialRaster` and `spatialVector`. Users should please start with the
`capeml` workflow, including creating a `config.yaml` file that will
feature project details that `spatialRaster` and `spatialVector` require
for processing.

### options

#### EML

This package defaults to the current version of EML. If desired, users
can switch to the previous version with
`emld::eml_version("eml-2.1.1")`.

#### project naming

Most EML-generating functions in the capeml and capemlGIS packages will
create both physical objects and EML references to those objects. By
default, the package will name output files with the format
`project identifier (number)`\_`object-name`.`file-extension` (e.g.,
*664\_site\_map.kml*). The target object (e.g., site\_map.png from the
previous example) is renamed with the additional metadata and this
object name is referenced in the EML metadata. Project naming can be
disabled by setting the `projectNaming` flag to `FALSE`. When set to
FALSE, the object name is not changed, and the name of the data object
as read into the R environment is written to file and referenced in the
EML. Note that the project identifier (number) is not passed as an
argument, and must exist in `config.yaml` (as `identiifer`).

### tools to generate entity metadata

*note that write\_attributes and write\_factors are in the capeml
package*

-   `write_attributes()` creates a template as a yaml file for supplying
    attribute metadata for a spatial vector object that resides in the R
    environment.
-   `write_factors()` creates a template as a yaml file for supplying
    code definition metadata for factors in vector data object that
    resides in the R environment.
-   `write_raster_factors()` creates a template as a csv file for
    supplying code definition metadata for spatial rasters if raster
    values are categorical.

### tools to create spatial data objects and corresponding EML metadata entities

-   `create_spatialRaster` Output includes:
    -   EML entity of type `spatialRaster`
    -   see
        [vignette](https://caplter.github.io/capeml/articles/create_spatialRaster.html)
        for more detail
-   `create_vector` Output includes:
    -   EML entity of type `spatialVector` that can be added to a EML
        dataset.
    -   Input data written to a kml or GeoJSON file with project naming
        (if selected).
-   `create_vector_shape` Output includes:
    -   EML entity of type `spatialVector` that can be added to a EML
        dataset.
    -   Input data **written** to a shapefile with project naming (if
        selected). Shapefile files are written to a directory that is
        zipped.
-   `package_vector_shape` Output includes:
    -   EML entity of type `spatialVector` that can be added to a EML
        dataset.
    -   **Harvests** all relevant files that constitute a single
        shapefile into a directory that is then zipped.
    -   `package_vector_shape` differs from the create\_\* series of
        functions in that it does not write data to file but rather
        packages the files that consititute a shapefile into a new
        directory that is then zipped for inclusion in a data package.
        Use package shape if it is important that the input data are not
        read into R or otherwise altered during the construction of the
        dataset. A limitation of this approach is that the data cannot
        be modified.

### overview: create a spatialVector

#### output to shapefile

``` r
# load spatial vector object; because create_vector_shape will generate a new
# shapefile, we have complete flexibility over the shapefile name and
# manipulating the data - here we are starting with an existing shapefile named
# CORETT but will generate a shapefile with the name
# ejido_titles_points_of_decree 

ejido_titles_points_of_decree <- sf::read_sf(
  dsn   = "data/Regularizacion/ejidal",
  layer = "CORETT"
  ) |>
dplyr::select(
  -OBJECTID_1,
  -FolderNumb,
  -Surface
  ) |>
dplyr::mutate(
  Id                                         = as.character(Id),
  across(where(is.character), ~ gsub(pattern = "\\r\\n", replacement = "", x = .)),
  across(where(is.character), ~ gsub(pattern = "--", replacement = NA_character_, x = .)),
  Year                                       = as.character(Year)
)

# write attributes (and factors if relevant)

try(
  capeml::write_attributes(
    dfname    = ejido_titles_points_of_decree,
    overwrite = FALSE
  )
)

# generate a description for the data entity

ejido_titles_points_of_decree_desc <- "polygons of land regularized by the
National Agency, CORETT; polygons were georeferenced from 281 paper maps,
consolidated into 87 unique regularization degrees of ejidos that became
privitzed from 1987-2007; includes the area of each polygon, the date of
regularization, the name of the ejido, the delegation, and the 'plane
number' that could be used to find the original map file in the CORETT
office; it only includes expropriation for the delegations Xochimilco,
Magdalena Contreras, Iztapalapa, Tlahuac, Gustavo Madero, Cuajimalpa, Alvaro
Obregon, Tlalpan, Coyoacan, and Milpa Alta"

ejido_titles_points_of_decree_SV <- capemlGIS::create_vector_shape(
  vector_name   = ejido_titles_points_of_decree,
  description   = ejido_titles_points_of_decree_desc,
  coord_sys     = "WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_55N",
  layer_opts    = "SHPT=POLYGON",
  overwrite     = TRUE,
  projectNaming = TRUE,
  )

# The resulting spatialVector entity can be added to a EML dataset.
# Note also in this example that we are passing additional layer options,
# which ultimately feed to sf::st_write, necessary here to generate a
# multi-polygon shapefile.
```

#### output to kml

The workflow for writing to kml or GeoJSON is nearly identical to the
workflow for writing to shapefile. Some differences include that we need
(or, at least, should) have a `Name` field if writing to kml file that
serves as a unique identifier for each data entity (added in the
workflow below as an additional line in the call to `mutate`). Also,
some parameters are different, such as unlike `create_vector_shape`,
which requires the user to pass an EML-compliant coordinate reference
system, since `create_vector` writes a new kml or GeoJSON file, the
resulting CRS is *always* EPSG 4326 and, thus, is hard-coded into the
function.

``` r
# load spatial vector object; because create_vector_shape will generate a new
# shapefile, we have complete flexibility over the shapefile name and
# manipulating the data - here we are starting with an existing shapefile named
# CORETT but will generate a shapefile with the name
# ejido_titles_points_of_decree 

ejido_titles_points_of_decree <- sf::read_sf(
  dsn   = "path-to-directory/",
  layer = "CORETT"
  ) |>
dplyr::select(
  -OBJECTID_1,
  -FolderNumb,
  -Surface
  ) |>
dplyr::mutate(
  Id                                         = as.character(Id),
  Name                                       = Id, # assign Name to the site identifier variable
  across(where(is.character), ~ gsub(pattern = "\\r\\n", replacement = "", x = .)),
  across(where(is.character), ~ gsub(pattern = "--", replacement = NA_character_, x = .)),
  Year                                       = as.character(Year)
)

# write attributes (and factors if relevant)

try(write_attributes(ejido_titles_points_of_decree, overwrite = FALSE))

# generate a description for the data entity

ejido_titles_points_of_decree_desc <- "polygons of land regularized by the
