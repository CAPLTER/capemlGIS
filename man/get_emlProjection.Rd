\title{get_emlProjection attempts to identify the projection of a spatial
data file, and match this to the corresponding projection ID permissible by
EML (deprecated)}
\usage{
get_emlProjection(spatialDataEntity)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatialDataEntity}{a spatial data entity, often loaded into R with the
raster (for rasters) or rgdal (for vectors) packages}
}
\value{
if a suitable match was found, function returns an EML-compliant
  listing of the projection of the spatial data object
}
\description{
get_emlProjection attempts to identify the projection of a
  spatial data file, and match this to the corresponding projection ID
  permissible by EML.
}
\details{
get_emlProjection is a helper function designed primarily to assist
  the creation of EML spatial data objects. The function currently is
  restricted to matching coordinate systems in the northern hemisphere, and
  will not match projections of type transverse mercator. Though intended
  primarily as a helper function, get_emlProjection can be run independently.
}
\note{
get_emlProjection currently is restricted to matching coordinate
  systems in the northern hemisphere, and will not match projections of type
  transverse mercator.
